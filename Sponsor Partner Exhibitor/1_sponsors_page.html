                  <p class="card-text text-muted">It all started in 1998, in a hostel room at IIT Mumbai. A conversation that debated the basic idea that the chemicals industry viewed pollution as something that needs to be controlled, while it should be prevented by recycling at source.
                      So it was in 1999, that this team of IIT technocrats came together, to use their expertise in chemistry and make the world a cleaner and greener place…and Newreka was born. The name is a combination of  “Nature’s Enthusiastic World” and “Eureka”, the ancient Greek word to celebrate discovery. And what a revelation it truly was…From its modest beginnings as a consultancy, the company now transformed into an award winning enviropreneur!  Its unmatched knowledge base of over 50,000 experiments conducted by a dedicated team of 50 Green Chemists and Green Chemical Engineers, State-of-the-Art Production facilities and Research and Development centres, contribute to its status as one of the pioneers of this technology in India. .Wherever in the world you may be, our expert care is just a phone call away.
