                    <p class="card-text text-muted">Continuous flow synthesis of azo dyes and compounds involving diazonium salts is known for last few years. However, most of these reports are based on very low concentrations and only useful as proof of the concept. This presentation will bring out a few interesting aspects of scale-up of such processes and the need to transform dye manufacturing in flow through process intensification. Process intensification is a design philosophy that can lead to substantial benefits in the areas of energy, capital investment, reduced process wastes and safety through radical changes in the processes. Though there are several ways of achieving it, advent of microreactors and continuous flow synthesis in miniaturized systems has revolutionized the concept of process intensification. Continuous flow synthesis will reduce the foot print of plant, reduce inventory in operation and help develop consistency in production quality. Synthesis of diazonium salts is exothermic and the salts are unstable (depending upon the aniline used) which need to be reacted immediately. For such a complex series-parallel combination of reactions, flow synthesis is an ideal approach. Conventionally available flow reactors in the market may or may not be suitable for such manufacturing as nature of salt and its possible adhesion to any surface can lead to unexpected operational issues. In this presentation a realistic overview of the variety of elements of this technology will be presented which practicing chemical engineers would find useful. While discussing many successful examples at lab scale and pilot scale important issues that one should monitor carefully will also be presented. While the technology is matured in certain application domains, it is necessary to evaluate the existing chemistries for enhancing the process performance in light of new technologies. In the end a few examples from the research at CSIR-NCL (Pune) will be highlighted including the Diazo Forum that has been started with a task to transform dyestuff industry in continuous mode, wherever necessary.
