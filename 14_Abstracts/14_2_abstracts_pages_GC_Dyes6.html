                    <p class="card-text text-muted">Responsible manufacturing is gaining importance in our business practices with every passing day. Traditionally, the emphasis was only cost/quality of product and quantity of production. The impact of textile manufacturing on consumers, workers, community and environment were accorded low priority. Responsible manufacture encompasses not just these impacts, but also conformance to social norms, use of resources (water, energy, chemicals, land, labor), waste management (generation and re-use), organisational values and ethics & fair play.
                        Chemicals are an important input in textile production processes and these chemicals find their way in 4 Outputs: the final product (fabric, yarn, garment), wastewater, sludge or air. Till about a decade back, a chemical was classified as hazardous if it was toxic i.e. it caused death through oral, dermal or inhalation routes or it resulted in some kind of skin or eye irritation or sensitization. But new findings on the impact of chemicals on human health and environment have led to a total of 18 hazard end- points for which data is required for hazard classification of a chemical formulation, including Carcinogenicity, Mutagenicity, Reprotoxicity (CMR), Endocrine Disruption, Target Organ Toxicity, Developmental/ Neurotoxicity, Persistence, Bioaccumulation and Aquatic Toxicity. There are more than 4 million substances registered with CAS (Chemical Abstracts Service) and we do not know the impact of almost 80% of these! It is thus imperative that the textile industry assumes greater responsibility of using safer and sustainable chemicals in manufacturing processes.
                        Chemical restrictions have been primarily driven by global conventions, legislation and apparel brand & retailers, with the focus mainly on consumer/product safety. The Greenpeace ‘Detox Now!’ campaign in 2011-12 highlighted the use and discharge of hazardous chemicals in textile production facilities across the globe and prompted global apparel & footwear brands to collaborate and lead the industry towards the zero discharge of hazardous chemicals across all pathways in their supply chains. The result was the ZDHC Roadmap to Zero Programme, a multi-stakeholder collaboration with a focus on a pro-active and holistic approach to chemicals management that went beyond product safety, brought into focus environmental safety in the manufacturing process and established a global chemical management framework that goes well beyond regulatory frameworks.
                        This presentation details the urgent need for responsible manufacturing through sustainable chemicals management and gives an overview of the ZDHC Programme elements such as:
                        	ZDHC MRSL (the industry standard for substances restrictions in chemical formulations)
                        	ZDHC Gateway (a tool for manufacturing facilities to implement the MRSL)
                        	ZDHC Wastewater Guidelines (the industry standard for wastewater discharge quality for conventional parameters and MRSL substances) 
                        	future initiatives under the ZDHC Programme that will lead to a holistic implementation of responsible textile manufacturing.
