                    <h6 class="card-subtitle abstract-topic mb-2">Recycle@SourceTM Solution: An effective alternative to reduce end-of-pipe treatment</h6>
                    <p class="card-text text-muted">Chemistry Intensive Chemical Industries like pharmaceuticals, dyes, pigments, agrochemcials, flavors & fragrance, specialty & fine chemicals, etc convert basic building blocks (like benzene, naphtalene, solvents, etc which are provided by the petro-chemicals industry) in to products which ultimately are used in manufacture of various products to address human needs.

                        Over the past three decades, increase in population has led to increase in demand for all products & this in turn has led to expansion in manufacturing capacity of chemistry intensive industries globally. This has led to proportional increase in the waste generated from these industries.
                        
                        These industries have multi-step processes (involving chemistries like sulphonaiton, nitration, reduction, diazotization, hydrolysis, condensation, acylation, etc) and each step generates a different kind of effluent. The presentation summarizes the present approach & common practice of “End-of-the-pipe-treatment” in the industry to treat effluent streams generated and the impact of that on economics & environment.
                        
                        In recent times, with environmental discharge norms getting more & more stringent leading to increase in treatment costs, increase in pressure from various environmental regulatory bodies on the indsutry to meet these norms, decreasing in profitability (due to reducing products prices & increasing raw material prices & increasing overheads), it has become very relevant for the industry to think differently and look for solutions that together addresses both environmental and economical concerns of the industry.
                        
                        The presentation emphasizes the need for “new tools” in the Green Chemistry tool box (new green chemistry based platform technlogies & solutions) which would offer both economical & environmental competitiveness.
                        
                        The concept of Recycle@SourceTM Solution is one such solution. Its a profit-centric approach to deal with environmental challenges associated with aqueous effluent streams. The solution enables industry to recycle their aqueous effluent streams back in the same process step as a reaction or extraction medium.
                        
                        Newreka has being investing its reosurces since last 5 years to develop Recycle@SourceTM Solution for some large volume dye intermediates & pharmaceutical intemediates, where E-Factor (kgs waste generated per kg of product) is very high. Two successful case studies of Nevirapine intermediate & H-Acid are shared in the presentation.
